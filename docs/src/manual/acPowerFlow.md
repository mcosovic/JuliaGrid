# [AC Power Flow](@id ACPowerFlowManual)
To perform the AC power flow analysis, you will first need the `PowerSystem` composite type that has been created with the `ac` model. Then, you can create the `ACPowerFlow` abstract type using one of the following functions:
* [`newtonRaphson`](@ref newtonRaphson),
* [`fastNewtonRaphsonBX`](@ref fastNewtonRaphsonBX),
* [`fastNewtonRaphsonXB`](@ref fastNewtonRaphsonXB),
* [`gaussSeidel`](@ref gaussSeidel).

These functions will set up the AC power flow framework. To obtain bus voltages and solve the power flow problem, you can use the following functions:
* [`mismatch!`](@ref mismatch!(::PowerSystem, ::NewtonRaphson)),
* [`solve!`](@ref solve!(::PowerSystem, ::NewtonRaphson)).

After obtaining the AC power flow solution, JuliaGrid offers post-processing analysis functions for calculating powers and currents associated with buses, branches, or generators:
* [`power!`](@ref power!(::PowerSystem, ::ACPowerFlow)),
* [`current!`](@ref current!(::PowerSystem, ::AC)).

Furthermore, there are specialized functions dedicated to calculating specific types of powers related to particular buses, branches, or generators:
* [`injectionPower`](@ref injectionPower(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`supplyPower`](@ref supplyPower(::PowerSystem, ::ACPowerFlow)),
* [`shuntPower`](@ref shuntPower(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`fromPower`](@ref fromPower(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`toPower`](@ref toPower(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`seriesPower`](@ref seriesPower(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`chargingPower`](@ref chargingPower(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`generatorPower`](@ref generatorPower(::PowerSystem, ::ACPowerFlow)).

Likewise, there are specialized functions dedicated to calculating specific types of currents related to particular buses or branches:
* [`injectionCurrent`](@ref injectionCurrent(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`fromCurrent`](@ref fromCurrent(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`toCurrent`](@ref toCurrent(::PowerSystem, ::AC)),
* [`seriesCurrent`](@ref seriesCurrent(::PowerSystem, ::AC)).

Additionally, the package provides two functions for reactive power limit validation of generators and adjusting the voltage angles to match an arbitrary bus angle:
* [`reactiveLimit!`](@ref reactiveLimit!),
* [`adjustAngle!`](@ref adjustAngle!).
