#  [State Estimation](@id runse)
To solve the state estimation problem three different modules are available:
* [non-linear state estimation](@ref nonlinearse),
* [linear DC state estimation](@ref lineardcse),
* [linear state estimation with PMUs only](@ref linearpmuse).
By default settings, the state estimation algorithms use the weighted least-squares estimation, but it is also possible to use the least absolute value estimation [1, Sec. 6.5].  

The non-linear state estimation is implemented using the following features:
 - the state vector is given in the polar coordinate system,
 - phasor measurements are given in the polar coordinate system,
 - measurement errors are uncorrelated,
 - the slack bus is included in the state estimation formulation.

The linear state estimation with PMUs] is implemented using the following features:
 - the state vector is given in the rectangular coordinate system,
 - phasor measurements are transformed from polar to rectangular coordinates,
 - the covariance matrix is transformed from polar to rectangular coordinates,
 - the slack bus is not included in the state estimation formulation.

Besides state estimation algorithms, we have implemented the bad data processing using the largest normalized
residual test [1, Sec. 5.7]. The routine proceeds with bad data analysis after the estimation process is finished, in the repetitive process of identifying and eliminating bad data measurements one after another.

The observability analysis with restore routine is based on the flow islands [2], [3], where pseudo-measurements are chosen between measurements that are marked as out-of-service in the input DATA.

## Run Settings
Input arguments of the function `runse()` describe the state estimation settings. The order of inputs and their appearance is arbitrary, with onlyÂ DATA input required. Still, for the methodological reasons, the syntax examples follow a certain order.

#### Syntax

runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE)
runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE, DISPLAY)
runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE, DISPLAY; ATTACH)
runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE, DISPLAY; ATTACH, SAVE)
```
```@raw html

#### Description
```julia-repl

## Input Data Structure
The function supports two input types: `.h5` or `.xlsx` file extensions. The measurement input data structure consists of variables `pmuVoltage` and `pmuCurrent` associated with phasor measurements, and `legacyFlow`, `legacyCurrent`, `legacyInjection` and `legacyVoltage` associated with legacy measurements. Further, the function requires knowledge about a power system using variables `bus`, `branch`, `generator` and `basePower`.

The minimum amount of information within an instance of the data structure required to run the module requires one variable associated with measurements, `bus` and `branch` variables.

We advise the reader to read the sections [Power System Data Structure](@ref powersysteminputdata) and [Measurement Data Structure](@ref measurementinputdata) which provides the structure of the input DATA, with numerous examples given in the section [Use Cases](@ref usecases).

---

## Output Data Structure
The state estimation function `runse()` returns a struct variable `results` with fields `main`, `flow`, `estimate`, `error`, `baddata` and `observability` containing state estimation analysis results. Further, the variables `measurements` and `system` contain the measurement and power system data, while the variable `info` contains a basic summary.

#### State Estimation
The `estimate` data structure contains summary of the state estimation analysis. The data is printed descriptively when displayed using a terminal, while the exported results are encoded with numeric values. Measurements that are marked as bad-measurement can only appear if the bad data analysis has been run, similarly pseudo-measurements occur if observability analysis is running.
