##  State Estimation (only DC)

The module runs the non-linear and DC state estimation, as well as the linear state estimation with PMUs only. By default settings, the state estimation algorithms use the weighted least-squares estimation, but it is also possible to use the least absolute value estimation [1, Sec. 6.5].  

The non-linear state estimation is implemented using the following features:
 - solved by the Gauss-Newton method,
 - the state vector is given in the polar coordinate system,
 - phasor measurements are given in the polar coordinate system,
 - measurement errors are uncorrelated.

The linear state estimation with PMUs only is implemented using the following features:
 - the state vector is given in the rectangular coordinate system,
 - phasor measurements are transformed from polar to rectangular coordinates,
 - the covariance matrix is transformed from polar to rectangular coordinates.

Besides state estimation algorithms, we have implemented the bad data processing using the largest normalized
residual test [1, Sec. 5.7]. The routine proceeds with bad data analysis after the estimation process is finished, in the repetitive process of identifying and eliminating bad data measurements one after another.

The observability analysis with restore routine is based on the flow islands [2], [3], where pseudo-measurements are chosen between measurements that are marked as out-service in the input DATA.

Finally, to achieve global observability of the power system only with PMUs, we implemented the optimal placement algorithm given in [4].

## Run Settings

Input arguments of the function `runse(...)` describe the state estimation settings. The order of inputs and their appearance is arbitrary, with onlyÂ DATA input required. Still, for the methodological reasons, the syntax examples follow a certain order.

#### Syntax
```julia-repl
runse(DATA, METHOD)
runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE)
runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE, DISPLAY)
runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE, DISPLAY; ATTACH)
runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE, DISPLAY; ATTACH, SAVE)
```

#### Description
```julia-repl
runse(DATA, METHOD) solves state estimation problem
runse(DATA, METHOD, ROUTINE) sets least absolute values estimation, bad data processing and observability analysis
runse(DATA, METHOD, LAVBAD, DISPLAY) shows results in the terminal
runse(DATA, METHOD, LAVBAD, DISPLAY; ATTACH) sets various options mostly related with ROUTINE
runse(DATA, METHOD, LAVBAD, DISPLAY; ATTACH, SAVE) exports results data
```

#### Output
```julia-repl
results, measurements, system, info = runse(...) returns results of the state estimation, measurements and power system data with a summary
```

####  Examples
```julia-repl
julia> results, = runse("case14se.xlsx", "dc", "main", "estimate", "error", "flow")
```
```julia-repl
julia> data = runmg("case14.h5"; runflow = 1, legacyset = "complete", legacyvariance = ["complete" 1e-4])
julia> results, = runse(data, "dc", "estimate"; bad = ["pass" 3 "threshold" 2])
```

## Input Data Structure
The function supports the `.h5` or `.xlsx` file extensions, with variables `pmuVoltage` and `pmuCurrent` associated with phasor measurements, and `legacyFlow`, `"legacyCurrent"`, `"legacyInjection"` and `"legacyVoltage"` associated with legacy measurements. Further, the function requires knowledge about a power system using variables `bus`, `branch`, `generator` and `"basePower"` variables.

The minimum amount of information within an instance of the data structure required to run the module requires one variable associated with measurements, `bus` and `branch` variables.

Next, we describe the structure of measurement variables involved in the input file, while variables associated with a power system are described in [Power Flow](@ref) section.

## Output Data Structure
The state estimation function `runpf(...)` returns a struct variable `results` with fields `main`, `flow`, `estimate`, `error`, `baddata` and `observability` containing state estimation analysis results. Further, the variables `measurements` and `system` contain the measurement and power system data, while the variable `info` contains a basic summary.

#### DC State estimation

The `main` data structure contains estimates of voltage angles and the calculated power injection based on them.

The `estimate` data structure contains summary of the state estimation analysis. The data is printed descriptively when displayed using a terminal, while the exported results are encoded with numeric values. Measurements that are marked as bad-measurement can only appear if the bad data analysis has been run, similarly pseudo-measurements occur if observability analysis is running.
