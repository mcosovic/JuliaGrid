# [Power Flow](@id runpf)

JuliaGrid is based on common network elements and benefits the [unified branch model](@ref branchmodel) to perform the power flow analysis, which is used for defining load profiles, generator capabilities, voltage specification, contingency analysis, and planning.

To solve the AC power flow problem three different methods are available:
* [Gauss-Seidel](@ref gaussseidel),
* [Newton-Raphson](@ref newtonraphson),
* [fast Newton-Raphson](@ref fastnewtonraphson) with XB and BX schemes.

By default, the AC power flow methods solve the system of non-linear equations and reveal complex bus voltages ignoring any limits. However, JuliaGrid integrates generator reactive power limits in all available methods.

Besides the AC power flow, JuliaGrid supports the [DC power flow](@ref dcpowerflow) model, which is obtained by linearisation of the non-linear model.

## Run Settings
Input arguments of the function `runpf()` describe the power flow settings. The order of inputs and their appearance is arbitrary, with onlyÂ DATA input required. Still, for the methodological reasons, the syntax examples follow a certain order.

#### Syntax
```julia-repl
runpf(DATA, METHOD)
runpf(DATA, METHOD, DISPLAY)
runpf(DATA, METHOD, DISPLAY; ACCONTROL)
runpf(DATA, METHOD, DISPLAY; ACCONTROL, SOLVE)
runpf(DATA, METHOD, DISPLAY; ACCONTROL, SOLVE, SAVE)
```
```@raw html
&nbsp;
```
#### Description
```julia-repl
runpf(DATA, METHOD) solves the power flow problem
runpf(DATA, METHOD, DISPLAY) shows results in the terminal
runpf(DATA, METHOD, DISPLAY; ACCONTROL) sets variables for the AC power flow
runpf(DATA, METHOD, DISPLAY; ACCONTROL, SOLVE) sets the linear system solver
runpf(DATA, METHOD, DISPLAY; ACCONTROL, SOLVE, SAVE) exports results
```
```@raw html
&nbsp;
```
#### Output
```julia-repl
results, system, info = runpf() returns results, power system and info data
```
```@raw html
&nbsp;
```
####  Examples
```julia-repl
results, system, info = runpf("case14.h5", "nr", "main", "flow", "generation")
```
```julia-repl
results, = runpf("case14.xlsx", "nr", "main"; max = 10, stop = 1.0e-8)
```
```julia-repl
results, = runpf("case14.h5", "gs", "main"; max = 500, stop = 1.0e-8, reactive = 1)
```
```julia-repl
results, = runpf("case14.h5", "dc"; solve = "lu", save = "D:/case14results.xlsx")
```

## Input Data Structure
The function supports two input types: `.h5` or `.xlsx` file extensions, where to describe a power system using the same input data structure as Matpower, except for the first column in the `branch` data. Note that, in the case of large-scale systems, we strongly recommend to use the `.h5` extension for the input as well as the output data.  

The minimum amount of information within an instance of the data structure required to run the module requires `bus` and `branch` variables.

We advise the reader to read the section [Power System Data Structure](@ref powersysteminputdata) which provides the structure of the input DATA, with numerous examples given in the section [Use Cases](@ref usecases).

---

## Output Data Structure
The power flow function `runpf()` returns a struct variable `results` with fields `main`, `flow`, `generation` containing power flow analysis results, and the additional field `iterations` for the AC power flow. Further, the variable `system` contains the input data that describes the power system, while the variable `info` contains basic information about the power system.
