## Measurement Generator

The function uses the AC power flow analysis or predefined user data to generate measurements. The standalone measurement generator produces measurement data in a form suitable for the state estimation function.

---

## Run Settings

The standalone measurement generator receives inputs for measurement variances, and inputs for measurement sets, to produce measurement data. There are two export formats supported for the measurement data, `.h5` or `.xlsx` file. The settings are provided as input arguments of the function `runmg(...)`.

The order of inputs and their appearance is arbitrary, with onlyÂ DATA input required. Still, for the methodological reasons, the syntax examples follow a certain order.

#### Syntax
```julia-repl
runmg(DATA)
runmg(DATA; RUNPF)
runmg(DATA; RUNPF, SET)
runmg(DATA; RUNPF, SET, VARIANCE)
runmg(DATA; RUNPF, SET, VARIANCE, ACCONTROL)
runmg(DATA; RUNPF, SET, VARIANCE, ACCONTROL, SAVE)
```

#### Description
```julia-repl
runmg(DATA) computes the AC power flow problem and generates measurements
runmg(DATA; RUNPF) sets AC power flow analysis
runmg(DATA; RUNPF, SET) defines the measurement set (in-service and out-service)
runmg(DATA; RUNPF, SET, VARIANCE) defines measurement values using predefined variances
runmg(DATA; RUNPF, SET, VARIANCE, ACCONTROL) sets variables for the AC power flow
runmg(DATA; RUNPF, SET, VARIANCE, ACCONTROL, SAVE) exports measurements and power system data
```

#### Output
```julia-repl
results = runmg(...) returns measurement and power system data with a summary
```

#### Examples
```julia-repl
julia> results = runmg("case14.xlsx"; pmuset = "optimal")
```
```julia-repl
julia> results = runmg("case14.xlsx"; pmuset = ["Iij" 5 "Vi" 2])
```
```julia-repl
julia> results = runmg("case14.xlsx"; pmuset = ["Iij" "all" "Vi" 2], legacyset = ["Pij" 4 "Qi" 8])
```
```julia-repl
julia> results = runmg("case14.h5"; legacyset = ["redundancy" 3.1], legacyvariance = ["all" 1e-4])
```
```julia-repl
julia> results = runmg("case14.h5"; legacyset = "all", legacyvariance = ["Pij" 1e-4 "all" 1e-5])
```

|------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`runpf = 1` | forces the AC power flow analysis to generate measurements, `default setting` |
|`runpf = 0` | generates measurements directly from the input DATA                           |

SET (phasor measurements)

| Command                                                      | Description                                                      |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|`pmuset = "all"`                                              | all phasor measurements are in-service                           |
|`pmuset = "optimal"`                                          | deploys phasor measurements according to the optimal PMU location using GLPK solver, where the system is completely observable only by phasor measurements |
|`pmuset = ["redundancy" value]`                              | deploys random angle and magnitude measurements measured by PMUs according to the corresponding redundancy |
|`pmuset = ["device" value]`                                   | deploys voltage and current phasor measurements according to the random selection of PMUs placed on buses, to deploy all devices use `"all"` as value |
|`pmuset = ["Iij" value "Dij" value "Vi" value "Ti" value]` | deploys phasor measurements according to the random selection of measurement types[^1], to deploy all selected measurements use `"all"` as value |

SET (legacy measurements)

| Command                                                                                  | Description                                      |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
|`legacyset = "all"`                                                                       | all legacy measurements are in-service           |
|`legacyset = ["redundancy " value]`                                                       | deploys random selection of legacy measurements according the corresponding redundancy |
|`legacyset = ["Pij" value "Qij" value "Iij" value "Pi" value "Qi" value "Vi" value]`      | deploys legacy measurements according to the random selection of measurement types[^2], to deploy all selected measurements use `"all"` as value |

!!! note "Set"
    If `runpf = 0`, the function keeps sets as in the input DATA and changes only the sets that are called using keywords. For example, if the keywords `pmuset` and `legacyset` are omitted, the function will retain the measurement set as in the input data, which allows the same measurement set, while changing the measurement variances.

    If `runpf = 1`, the function starts with all the measurement sets marked as out-service.  

    Further, the function accept any subset of phasor[^1] or legacy[^2] measurements, and consequently, it is not necessary to define attributes for all measurements.  
    ```julia-repl
    julia> runmg("case14.h5"; pmuset = ["Iij" "all" "Vi" 2])
    ```
    Thus, the measurement set will consist of two randomly selected bus voltage magnitude measurements, and all branch current magnitude measurements, both of them related with PMUs.  



VARIANCE (phasor measurements)

| Command                                                           | Description                                                                               |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`pmuvariance = ["all" value]`                                      | applies fixed-value variance over all phasor measurements                                 |
|`pmuvariance = ["random" min max]`                                 | selects variances uniformly at random within limits, applied over all phasor measurements |
|`pmuvariance = ["Iij" value "Dij" value "Vi" value "Ti" value "all" value]` | predefines variances over a given subset of phasor measurements[^1]; to apply fixed-value variance over all, except for those individually defined use `"all" value`                       |

VARIANCE (legacy measurements)

| Command                                                      | Description                                                                       |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`legacyvariance = ["all" value]`                              | applies fixed-value variance over all phasor measurements |
|`legacyvariance = ["random" min max]`                    | selects variances uniformly at random within limits, applied over all phasor measurements |
|`legacyvariance = ["Pij" value "Qij" value "Iij" value "Pi" value "Qi" value "Vi" value "all" value]` | predefines variances over a given subset of phasor measurements[^2], to apply fixed-value variance over all, except for those individually defined use `"all" value`    |

!!! note "Variance"
    If `runpf = 0`, the function keeps measurement values and measurement variances as in the input DATA, and changes only measurement values and variances that are called using keywords. For example, if the keywords `pmuvariance` and `legacyvariance` are omitted, the function will retain the measurement values and variances as in the input data, allowing the same measurement values and variances, while changing the measurement sets.

    If `runpf = 1`, the function starts with zero variances, meaning that measurement values are equal to the exact values.

    Further, the function accepts any subset of phasor[^1] or legacy[^2] measurements, consequently, it is not necessary to define attributes for all measurements, where keyword `"all"` generates measurement values according to defined variance for all measurements, except for those individually defined.   
    ```julia-repl
    julia> runmg("case14.h5"; legacyvariance = ["Pij" 1e-4 "all" 1e-5])
    ```
    The function applies variance value of 1e-5 over all legacy measurements, except for active power flow measurements which have variance equal to 1e-4.

---

## Data Structure
The function supports the `.h5` or `.xlsx` file extensions, with variables `pmuVoltage` and `pmuCurrents` associated with phasor measurements, and `legacyFlow`, `"legacyCurrent"`, `"legacyInjection"` and `"legacyVoltage"` associated with legacy measurements. Further, the function requires knowledge about a power system using variables `bus`, `branch`, `generator` and `"basePower"` variables.

The minimum amount of information within an instance of the data structure required to run the module requires one variable associated with measurements if `runflow = 0`, and `bus` and `branch` variables.

Next, we describe the structure of measurement variables involved in the input/output file, while variables associated with a power system are described in [Power Flow](@ref) section.

!!! note "Optional column: label"
    The optional column label is useful to use when several PMUs exist on a single bus, where labels used in the variable `pmuCurrent` should be consistent with labels in the variable `pmuVoltage`.
