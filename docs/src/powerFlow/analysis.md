# [Power Flow Analysis](@id powerFlowAnalysis)

Once the bus voltages are obtained, it is possible to calculate powers related to buses, powers and currents related to branches, and powers related to generators:
* [`bus!()`](@ref bus!)
* [`branch!()`](@ref branch!)
* [`generator!()`](@ref generator!).
