JuliaGrid is an open-source and easy-to-use simulation tool and solver designed for researchers and educators. It is available as a Julia package, with its source code released under the MIT License. JuliaGrid primarily focuses on steady-state power system analyses, offering a versatile set of algorithms and easy manipulation of power system configuration and analyses.

We have rigorously tested and validated our simulation tool across various scenarios to the best of our abilities. Your feedback on errors, inaccuracies, or bugs as a user would be highly appreciated and can help improve future versions. For more details, visit our [documentation][documentation] site.
